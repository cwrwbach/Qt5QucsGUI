# Qt5QucsGUI
Simple Qt5 front end for QUCS simulator. This is very much a work in progress.

The idea is to make a filter netlist with arbitrary circuit component values and have that simulated using the QUCS command-line tools.
The output from the simulator will be displayed using the Qt5 "QtCharts" component.

Repeat: This is very much a work in progress.
